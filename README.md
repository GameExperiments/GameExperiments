# Hi! I am Sergey

I am a Junior Developer, and actively develop and maintain back-end systems. Proficient in Python and Epic Games' programming language called Verse used in UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite), and have moderate knowledge of C++ and Lua.

## My projects

Being a programmer for 5+ years, I have worked on multiple projects that have enhanced my skills. Some notable projects include:

* Bots: Developed bots for Telegram, Discord, Spotify and other platforms, using their APIs for different purposes.
* Audio synchronizer for Reaper: Made a ReaScript plugin for synchronizing audio based on the .SRT file.
* Google Sheets Integration Program: Created a program that interacts with Google Sheets, Telegram, and local files, automating every day tasks.
* PyQt5 Interface Program: Developed programs with interface made with PyQt5, creating an intuitive user experience and seamless interaction with the application.
* PyGame: Created a game using PyGame, a Python library for making games.
* Unreal Editor for Fortnite: Developed more than 7 games for Fortnite using UEFN and Verse programming language.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you have a project that you think I can help with, feel free to contact me.
