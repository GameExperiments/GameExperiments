I am a Junior Developer, and actively develop and maintain back-end systems. My primary programming language is Python, however I can write programs is C++, Lua, and Epic Games' programming language called Verse as well.

Since 2020, I have worked on multiple projects that have enchanced my skills. Some notable projects include:
1. Bots for Telegram and Discord:
Developed bots for Telegram and Discord, using their APIs for different purposes.
2. Audio syncronizer for Reaper:
Made a ReaScript plugin for syncrinizing audio with the roles, based on the narrator.
3. Google Sheets Integration Program:
Created a program that interacts with Google Sheets, Telegram, and local files, automating every day tasks.
5. PyQt5 Interface Program:
Developed a program with an interface using the PyQt5 library, creating an intuitive user experience and seamless interaction with the application.

These projects were my foundation, and I'm ready to move on to something new.

Forever and Ever
